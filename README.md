Task: Using PyTorch to predict correct starting word between 'they're', 'their', and 'there'.

Content: I have a linear model (with ReLU transformations and 5 layers) as well as a bidirectional RNN model.

Here, my RNN model has the settings for the lowest processing power as possible to achieve comparable results (also, given the small dataset).

Tools:
(I coded both models in Jupyter notebooks. Both of these use PyTorch, and the data preprocessing is done mostly in pandas before changing the data to torch tensor datatypes.)
